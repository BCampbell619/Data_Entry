			    Each one of these rules&#44; except for eComm&#44; holds a layer of detail underneath&#46; The detail of each rule is logic that tells 
			    the system to select one store and build a wave for that store&#46; So simply put&#44; each rule contains one store to build&#46;</p><br>
			    
			    <h2>Requirements &amp; Best Practices</h2>
			
			    <p class="note"><strong>NOTE&#58;</strong> First&#44; before building waves there needs to be a double check between the shipping cubes and the 
			    wave sheet&#46; Both sheets need to match one another before proceeding with building out the schedule&#46; If this is omitted&#44; this could 
			    increase errors and cause the re&ndash;work of the wave sheet&#46;<br><br>
			    <span class="italy">&#42;&#42;It is required to check the schedules before building&#42;&#42;</span></p><br>
			
			    <p>To verify a store that a rule contains take an option 5 against the rule and press &lsquo;Enter&rsquo;&#46; The depiction below is what will be displayed 
			    to you&#58;</p>

			<div class="subHead">
			
			    <p>It may be a good practice to check the first 3 to 5 rules before building &ndash; just to make sure everything looks right&#46; 
			    The process of building waves is pretty simple and straight forward&#59; however&#44; it is also easy to make a mistake&#44; If you 
			    ever become unsure of where you&#39;re at&#44; slow down and check yourself before proceeding&#46; Double checking and triple checking is 
			    preferred over doubling or tripling your work because of mistakes&#46;</p>
			    
			    <h2>Building a Wave</h2>
			    
			    <p>To build a wave the first step is to &lsquo;Activate&rsquo; the rule&#46; This is acheived by taking option &lsquo;A&rsquo; against 
			    the rule and pressing &lsquo;Enter&rsquo;&#46; Once this is done the rule will look as it does in the depiction below&#46; Only one 
			    rule is activated and submitted at a time&#46;</p>
			
			</div><!-- end of subHead in body class -->
			
			<div class="example">

			<div class="subHead">
			    
			    <p class="note"><strong>NOTE&#58;</strong> A behavior of the system you will need to be aware of is depicted below&#46; The rule list is sorted by 
			    the status of the rule&#46; Since &lsquo;A&rsquo; comes before &lsquo;I&rsquo;&#44; the active rule always appears at the top of the list despite 
			    its rule number&#46; Once you activate a rule you know you can always find it at the top of the list&#46;</p>

			<div class="subHead">
			    
			    <p>After a rule has been activated&#44; press function key &lsquo;F16&rsquo;&#46; This will bring up the 
			    &lsquo;Generate Retail Pick Wave&rsquo; screen as shown below&#46; All the information on this screen need not overwhelm you&#46; 
			    All that needs to be done on this screen is to press function key &lsquo;F16&rsquo; again to submit the wave&#46; Once the wave 
			    is submitted you will be taken back to the rule list screen&#46;</p><br>
			    
                <p class="note"><strong>NOTE&#58;</strong> Something to be aware of when building waves is <strong>multiple active rules</strong>&#46;<br><br>
                
                <span class="italy">Scenario 1&#58;</span> When a wave has been submitted through the &lsquo;Generate Retail Pick Wave&rsquo; screen and 
                instead of returning to the rule list screen you receive another &lsquo;Generate Retail Pick Wave&rsquo; screen &ndash; you have another 
                rule active from another day&#47;schedule&#46; This will only occur when rules are active for two different days &#40;i&#46;e&#46; one on 
                Monday and one on Tuesday&#41;&#46; Taking a look at the &lsquo;Wave Description&rsquo; field in the upper right hand corner will tell you 
                what day the rule is on&#46; If you manage to avoid submitting the errant rule&#44; simply press function key &lsquo;F12&rsquo; two times 
                to return to the selection screen and select the day to inactivate the rule&#46; If you do submit the errant rule&#44; then you will end 
                up with a &lsquo;dead&rsquo; wave and will have to re&ndash;number your wave sheet&#46;<br><br>
			    
			    <span class="italy">Scenario 2&#58;</span> However&#44; if two rules are active on the same schedule &#40;i&#46;e&#46; two on Monday&#41; 
			    then there will only one submission from the &lsquo;Generate Retail Pick Wave&rsquo; screen&#46; The wave&#44; however&#44; will have two 
			    stores within it&#46; This scenario is worse than the first&#46; There are methods available to reverse this error&#44; but please prevent 
			    it from happening in the first place&#46;<br><br>
			    
			    Both of the scenarios need to be avoided when possible&#46;</p>

			    <p>After the wave has been submitted and you return to the rule list screen the next step is to &lsquo;Inactivate&lsquo; the rule&#46; This is accomplished
