				<h2>Task ID</h2>

				<p>The Task ID or Task Number is singular in that it deals with only one SKU at a time. 
				In the screen shot above, Task 0957107727 only deals with SKU 04524849. 
				Thus, this Task Number is a singular replenishment for SKU 04524849.</p>

			<div class="note"> 
				<h5>NOTE&#58;</h5>
				<span class="italy">Although Tasks are singular replenishments for a particular SKU, there can be multiple replenishments against a single SKU on multiple waves. 
				This will be explained later in the guide&#46;</span>

			</div><!-- end of note class -->

				<h2>SKU</h2>

				<p>The SKU, as explained in the Task ID section, is the SKU that is being replenished&#46;</p>

				<h2>From &amp; To</h2>

				<p>The &ldquo;From&rdquo; is the reserve location where the pallet of merchandise resides&#46; 
				A forklift driver will be directed to this location &#40;via the task&#41; and then take the pallet &ldquo;To&rdquo; the active picking location&#46; 
				The active picking location is where the SKU is physically being picked&#46;</p>

				<h2>Priority</h2>

				<ol type="i">

					<li>The priority is something that the Waver can manipulate to move up or down the priority chain</li>
					<li>All lean time wave replenishment tasks are built at a priority level of 60</li>
					<li>Lean time tasks that are built after the waving process are built at a priority level of 70</li>
					<li>A Priority level of 65 is tasks that are coming from the receiving dock to the pick/drop zones &#40;<span class="italy">See note below</span>&#41;</li>
					<li>A priority level of 40 is when the replenishment needs to happen before the wave is reached by the order fillers &#40;<span class="italy">See note below</span>&#41;</li>
					<li>A priority level 50 is when the replenishment needs to occur within the wave &#40;<span class="italy">See note below</span>&#41;</li>
					<li>When the balance on hand &#40;BOH&#41; is below the minimum inventory threshold the system will bump the priority of the task to a level 35</li>
					<li>Any other priority levels outside of these defined priorities would have been manipulated by the Waver</li>

				</ol>

				<div class="note">

					<h5>NOTE&#58;</h5>

					<p><span class="italy">Drop Zones</span> &ndash; Drop Zones are used in the C&#44; D&#44; and Q modules where stock employees replenish on foot rather than by forklift &ndash; This is further explained in the &ldquo;Status&rdquo; section</p><br>
					<p><span class="italy">Priority 40</span> &ndash; The active location has zero inventory by the time the order filler reaches that wave</p><br>
					<p><span class="italy">Priority 50</span> &ndash; The inventory within the active location will not satisfy what is to be pulled on the wave&#59; however&#44; the inventory is not at zero</p>


				</div><!-- end of note class -->

				<h2>BOH</h2>

				<p>The &ldquo;BOH&rdquo; or Balance On Hand column shows how much inventory exists in the active picking location&#46;</p>

				<h2>TBP</h2>

				<p>The &ldquo;TBP&rdquo; or To Be Picked column shows how much any given SKU will be picked throughout the wave schedule&#46;</p>

				<h2>TBF</h2>

				<p>The &ldquo;TBF&rdquo; or To Be Filled column shows how much will be replenished into the active picking location for <span class="italy">that</span> particular task&#46;</p>

				<h2>MAX</h2>

				<p>The Max column displays the maximum amount of inventory the actual picking location can hold&#46;</p>

				<div class="ponder">

					<p><strong>QUESTION</strong>&ndash; What happens if a replenishment task&#39;s to be filled amount exceeds the maximum of a pick location&#63;</p><br>
					<p>The next section will go over some key indicators that help the user of the Wave Replenishment Tasks report make educated decisions</p>

				<p>When an asterisk &#40;*&#41; appears next to a task number it signifies that there are multiple tasks created for that SKU&#40;s&#41;&#46;</p><br>
				<p>Caution should be used when an asterisk is present for the following reason&#40;s&#41;&#58;</p>

				<ol type="1">
					<li>Too many tasks could be opened for the active location&#46; 
					This can result in extra work for the forklift department by having to consume the pallets out of the active location&#44; 
					and then take the extra pallets back to a reserve location&#46;</li>
					<li>Releasing newer tasks ahead of older tasks&#46; 
					This can occur when working with the deeper pages of the Wave Replenishment Report&#46;

			<h2>Status &#40;00&#44; 08&#44; 10&#44; 15&#44; 20&#41;</h2>

			<div class="subHead">

				<p><strong>00</strong> &ndash; This status represents that the task is &ldquo;released&rdquo; and available to be worked by a forklift driver or stock clerk&#46;</p><br>

				<p><strong>08</strong> &ndash; This status represents that the task is in the &ldquo;Drop Zone&rdquo;&#46; This is only the case with the C&#44; D&#44; &amp; Q modules&#46;</p><br>

				<p>To Further explain what the &ldquo;Drop Zone&rdquo; is&#44; it is important to point out a few details&#58;</p>
	
				<ul>
					<li>All &ldquo;external&rdquo; reserve locations exist in the following area locations &ndash; N&#44; O&#44; 

						<div class="tooltip"><span class="diff italy">P</span>
						<p class="tooltiptext">PC&#44; D&#44; G&#44; H&#44; have active locations as well&#44; but these picking locations have reserves above them&#46;</p></div>&#44; 

						<div class="tooltip"><span class="diff italy">Q</span>
						<p class="tooltiptext">QT &amp; QU have active locations&#44; as well as reserves above them&#46;</p></div>&#44; 

					R&#44; S&#44; 

						<div class="tooltip"><span class="diff italy">T</span>

						<p class="tooltiptext">TI is an active picking location within the T reserves</p></div>&#44; 

					&amp; U</li>

					<li>Forklift drivers take pallets from the receiving dock to these reserve locations&#44; 
					as well as take pallets from these same reserve locations and put them into active picking locations 
					&#40;<span class="italy">such as BA&ndash;M&#44; E&ndash;L&#44; PC&ndash;D&#44; PG&ndash;H&#44; PK&ndash;M&#44; QT&#44;  &amp; QU</span>&#41;</li>

					<li>C&#44; D&#44; &amp; Q have additional rack space built on the outside of the module&#44; 
					which prevents forklift drivers from putting the pallets directly into the active location&#40;s&#41;&#46; The reason&#63; The C&#44; D&#44; &amp; Q modules are &ldquo;case flow&rdquo; modules&#44; 
					meaning the active locations are filled by placing cases into the location by hand</li>

					<li>Thus&#44; when a forklift driver places a pallet into any of these rack spaces outside of the 
					C&#44; D&#44; &amp; Q modules the status changes to &ldquo;08&rdquo; because it is in the &ldquo;Drop Zone&rdquo;</li>

					<li>This then becomes the responsibility of a stock clerk to finish the task into the active location</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>10</strong> &ndash; This status represents an instance when a forklift driver or stock clerk has &ldquo;picked up&rdquo; an open task&#46;</p><br>

				<p><strong>15</strong> &ndash; This status represents that a task is &ldquo;held&rdquo; and is not able to be worked by a forklift driver or stock clerk until it is released
				by the Waver or by the System&#46;</p><br>

				<p><strong>20</strong> &ndash; This status represents that a forklift driver or stock clerk is in the middle of executing the task&#46;</p>

				<div class="note">
			
					<h5>NOTE&#58;</h5>				

					<p>A Status 20&#44; essentially&#44; is the last status one will see a task in with this report&#44; unless it is going to the &ldquo;drop zone&rdquo;&#46; 
					Once a driver or clerk finishes executing the task&#44; the task is finished and will drop from the report</p>

			<h2>Broken Tasks</h2>

			<div class="subHead">

				<p>A broken task has the following characteristics&#58;</p>

				<ul>
					<li>The TBP is greater than the BOH&#44; yet a single pallet quantity will satisfy the replenishment need 
					&#40;<span class="italy">Basically&#44; One task for the entire waving schedule</span>&#41;</li>

					<li>The entire pallet quantity will not fit into the active location&#44; only a portion will&#46; 
					This is due to the fact that most of the locations in the C &amp; D module are replenished by hand&#44; and only have space large enough to hold a certain amount of cases&#46; 
					Thus&#44; if an entire pallet quantity exceeds that amount of cases than location can hold the remainder has to be put back into reserve 
					&#40;<span class="italy">These reserves exist internally in both the C &amp; D modules</span>&#41;</li>

					<li>The remainder that does not fit in the active location are consumed out of that location and located to an internal reserve within the module</li>

				</ul>

			</div><!-- end of subHead class for exceptions -->

			<div class="example">

				<h5>To illustrate a broken task consider the following scenario&#58;</h5>

				<ul>
					<li>150 units need to be picked through the waving schedule for a single SKU in the D module</li>

					<li>Only 50 units are actually in the active location&#46; The active location can only hold a maximum of 100 units</li>

					<li>The system generates one task with a pallet quantity of 200 units</li>

					<li>The task is executed&#59; however&#44; only 50 units are put in the location and the remaining 150 units of the pallet are put to an internal reserve location</li>
